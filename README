gtkgst is a set of libraries which provide easy support for embedding
GStreamer video into Gtk.

It provides GTK widgets (GtkGstWidget and GtkGstGLWidget) that can
integrate with the provided GStreamer elements (gtksink and gtkglsink)
to display video in a GTK UI.

See the tests/examples sub-directory for example code.
